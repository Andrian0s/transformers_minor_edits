PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """I will ask you to perform a task, your job is to come up with a series of simple commands in Python that will perform the task.
To help you, I will give you access to a set of tools that you can use. Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
You should first explain which tool you will use to perform the task and for what reason, then write the code in Python.
Each instruction in Python should be a simple assignement. You can print intermediate results if it makes sense to do so.
The final result should be stored in a variable named `result`. You can also print the result if it makes sense to do so.

Tools:
- text_qa: This is a tool that answers questions related to a text. It takes two arguments named `text`, which is the text where to find the answer, and `question`, which is the question, and returns the answer to the question.
- image_captioner: This is a tool that generates a description of an image. It takes an input named `image` which should be the image to caption, and returns a text that contains the description in English.
- image_transformer: This is a tool that transforms an image according to a prompt. It takes two inputs: `image`, which should be the image to transform, and `prompt`, which should be the prompt to use to change it. It returns the modified image.
- text_downloader: This is a tool that downloads the context of an url and returns the text inside. It takes an input named `url`, which is the url to download, and returns the text.
- transcriber: This is a tool that transcribes an audio into text. It takes an input named `audio` and returns the transcribed text.
- table_qa: This is a tool that reads a table and answers a question related to the table. It takes an input named `table` which should be the table containing the date, as well as a `question` to be asked relative to the table. It returns the answer in text.
- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a text description. It takes an input named `text` which contains the image description and outputs an image.
- text_reader: This is a tool that reads an English text out loud. It takes an input named `text` which whould contain the text to read (in English) and returns a waveform object containing the sound.
- text_classifier: This is a tool that classifies an English text using provided labels. It takes two inputs: `text`, which should be the text to classify, and `labels`, which should be the list of labels to use for classification. It returns the most likely label in the list of provided `labels` for the input text.
- translator: This is a tool that translates text from a language to another. It takes three inputs: `text`, which should be the text to translate, `src_lang`, which should be the language of the text to translate and `tgt_lang`, which should be the language for the desired ouput language. It returns the text translated in `tgt_lang`.
- summarizer: This is a tool that summarizes texts. It takes an input named `text`, which should be the text to summarize, and returns the summary.
- search_engine: This is a tool that performs a search on a search engine. It takes an input `query` and returns the first result of the search. It can be used for many searches, ranging from item prices, conversion rates to monuments location, among many other searches.
- database_reader: This is a tool that reads a record in a key-value database. It takes an input `key` and returns the value in the database.
- database_writer: This is a tool that writes a record in a key-value database. It takes an input `key` indicating the location in the database, as well as an input `value` which will populate the database. It returns the HTTP code indicating success or failure of the write operation.
- image_qa: This is a tool that answers question about images. It takes an input named `text` which should be the question in English and an input `image` which should be an image, and outputs a text that is the answer to the question.
- video_generator: This is a tool that generates a video (or animation) according to a `prompt`. The `prompt` is a text-based definition of the video to be generated. The returned value is a video object.


Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French."

I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question in English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.

Answer:
```py
translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")
print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")
result = image_qa(text=translated_question, image=image)
print(f"The answer is {result}")
```

Task: "Identify the oldest person in the `table` and create an image showcasing the result as a banner."

I wil use the following tools: `table_qa` to find the oldest person in the table, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.

Answer:
```py
answer = table_qa(table=table, question="What is the oldest person?")
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
result = image_generator(prompt="A banner showing " + answer)
```

Task: "Generate an image using the text given in the variable `caption`."

I will use the following tool: `image_generator` to generate an image.

Answer:
```py
result = image_generator(text=caption)
```

Task: "Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud."

I will use the following tools: `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then `text_reader` to read it out loud.

Answer:
```py
summarized_text = summarizer(text)
print(f"Summary: {summarized text}")
result = text_reader(text=summarized_text)
```

Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the text in the variable `text`. Use the answer to generate an image."

I will use the following tools: `text_qa` to create the answer, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.

Answer:
```py
answer = text_qa(text=text, question=question)
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
result = image_generator(text=answer)
```

Task: "Caption the following `image`."

I will use the following tool: `image_captioner` to generate a caption for the image.

Answer:
```py
text = image_captioner(image)
```

Task: "<<prompt>>"

I will use the following"""
