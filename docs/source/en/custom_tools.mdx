# Custom Tools

<Tip>

If you are not aware of what tools and agents are in the context of transformers, we recommend you read the
[Transformers Agents](transformers_agents) page first.

</Tip>

Creating and using custom tools is paramount to empowering the agent and having it perform new tasks. In this guide
we'll take a look at how to use custom tools, as well as how to create one yourself.

## Using custom tools

In this section, we'll be leveraging two existing custom tools that are not included in the default toolbox. We'll
use:
- The [diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool) in order to
  replace the existing text-transformation tool.

### Adding new tools

In this section we'll add a new tool so that the agent may benefit from it.

#### Creating a new tool

We'll first start by creating a tool. We'll add the not-so-useful yet fun task of fetching the model on the Hugging Face
Hub with the most downloads for a given task.

We can do that with the following code:

```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models

task = 'text-classification'

model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort='downloads', direction=-1)))
print(f"{model.id} with {model.downloads} downloads over the past 30 days.")
```

For the task `text-classification`, this returns `'facebook/bart-large-mnli with 3427611 downloads over the past 30 
days.'`, for `translation` it returns `'t5-base with 8474765 downloads over the past 30 days.'`.

How do we convert this to a tool that the agent can leverage? All tools depend of the superclass `Tool` that holds the
main attributes necessary. We'll create a class that inherits from it:

```python
from transformers import Tool

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    pass
```

This class has a few needs:
- An attribute `name`, which corresponds to the name of the tool itself. To be in tune with other tools which have a
  performative name, we'll name it `text-download-counter`.
- An attribute `description`, which will be used to populate the prompt of the agent.
- `inputs` and `outputs` attributes. Defining this will help the python interpreter make educated choices about types,
  and will allow for a gradio-demo to be spawned when we push our tool to the Hub. They're both a list of expected
  values, which can be `text`, `image`, or `audio`.
- A `__call__` method which contains the inference code. This is the code we've played with above!

Here's what our class looks like now:

```python
from transformers import Tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
  name = 'model-download-counter'
  description = (
    "This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub. "
    "It takes the name of the category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc), and "
    "returns the name of the checkpoint alongside its 30-day download numbers."
  )

  inputs = ['text']
  outputs = ['text']

  def __call__(self, task: str):
    model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort='downloads', direction=-1)))
    return f"{model.id} with {model.downloads} downloads over the past 30 days."
```

We now have our tool handy. Save it in a file and import it from your main script. I'm naming this file
`model_downloads.py`, so the resulting import code looks like this:

```python
from model_downloads import HFModelDownloadsTool

tool = HFModelDownloadsTool()
```
In order to let others benefit from it and for simpler initialization, we recommend pushing it to the Hub under your 
namespace. To do so, just call `push_to_hub` on the `tool` variable:

```python
tool.push_to_hub('lysandre/hf-model-downloads')
```

You now have your code on the Hub! Let's take a look at the final step, which is to have the agent use it.

#### Having the agent use the tool

We now have our tool that lives on the Hub which can be instantiated as such:

```python
from transformers import load_tool

tool = load_tool('lysandre/hf-model-downloads')
```

In order to use it in the agent, simply pass it in the `additional_tools` parameter of the agent initialization method:

```python
from transformers.tools import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder", additional_tools=[tool])
```

### Replacing existing tools

In this section we'll take a look at replacing the text-transformation tool. So far, that's how we would leverage the
text-transformation tool:

```python
from transformers.tools import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder")

image = agent.chat("Create a picture of a river passing through a ravine")
```
