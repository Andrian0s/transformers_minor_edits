# Custom Tools

<Tip>

If you are not aware of what tools and agents are in the context of transformers, we recommend you read the
[Transformers Agents](transformers_agents) page first.

</Tip>

Creating and using custom tools is paramount to empowering the agent and having it perform new tasks. In this guide
we'll take a look at how to use custom tools, as well as how to create one yourself.

## Using custom tools

In this section, we'll be leveraging two existing custom tools that are not included in the default toolbox. We'll
use:
- The [diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool) in order to
  replace the existing text-transformation tool.

### Adding new tools


### Replacing existing tools

In this section we'll take a look at replacing the text-transformation tool. So far, that's how we would leverage the
text-transformation tool:

```python
from transformers.tools import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder")


image = agent.chat("Create a picture of a river passing through a ravine")
```
