# Custom Tools

<Tip>

If you are not aware of what tools and agents are in the context of transformers, we recommend you read the
[Transformers Agents](transformers_agents) page first.

</Tip>

Creating and using custom tools is paramount to empowering the agent and having it perform new tasks. In this guide
we'll take a look at how to use custom tools, as well as how to create one yourself.

## Using custom tools

In this section, we'll be leveraging two existing custom tools that are not included in the default toolbox. We'll
use:
- The [diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool) in order to
  replace the existing text-transformation tool.

### Adding new tools

In this section we'll add a new tool so that the agent may benefit from it.

#### Creating a new tool

We'll first start by creating a tool. We'll add the not-so-useful yet fun task of fetching the model on the Hugging Face
Hub with the most downloads for a given task.

We can do that with the following code:

```python
from huggingface_hub import list_models

task = 'text-classification'

model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort='downloads', direction=-1)))
print(model.id)
```

For the task `text-classification`, this returns `'facebook/bart-large-mnli'`, for `translation` it returns `'t5-base`.

How do we convert this to a tool that the agent can leverage? All tools depend on the superclass `Tool` that holds the
main attributes necessary. We'll create a class that inherits from it:

```python
from transformers import Tool

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
    pass
```

This class has a few needs:
- An attribute `name`, which corresponds to the name of the tool itself. To be in tune with other tools which have a
  performative name, we'll name it `text-download-counter`.
- An attribute `description`, which will be used to populate the prompt of the agent.
- `inputs` and `outputs` attributes. Defining this will help the python interpreter make educated choices about types,
  and will allow for a gradio-demo to be spawned when we push our tool to the Hub. They're both a list of expected
  values, which can be `text`, `image`, or `audio`.
- A `__call__` method which contains the inference code. This is the code we've played with above!

Here's what our class looks like now:

```python
from transformers import Tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

class HFModelDownloadsTool(Tool):
  name = 'model-download-counter'
  description = (
    "This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub. "
    "It takes the name of the category (such as text-classification, depth-estimation, etc), and "
    "returns the name of the checkpoint."
  )

  inputs = ['text']
  outputs = ['text']

  def __call__(self, task: str):
    model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort='downloads', direction=-1)))
    return model.id
```

We now have our tool handy. Save it in a file and import it from your main script. I'm naming this file
`model_downloads.py`, so the resulting import code looks like this:

```python
from model_downloads import HFModelDownloadsTool

tool = HFModelDownloadsTool()
```
In order to let others benefit from it and for simpler initialization, we recommend pushing it to the Hub under your 
namespace. To do so, just call `push_to_hub` on the `tool` variable:

```python
tool.push_to_hub('lysandre/hf-model-downloads')
```

You now have your code on the Hub! Let's take a look at the final step, which is to have the agent use it.

#### Having the agent use the tool

We now have our tool that lives on the Hub which can be instantiated as such:

```python
from transformers import load_tool

tool = load_tool('lysandre/hf-model-downloads')
```

In order to use it in the agent, simply pass it in the `additional_tools` parameter of the agent initialization method:

```python
from transformers.tools import HfAgent

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder", additional_tools=[tool])

agent.run("Can you read out loud the name of the model that has the most download in the 'text-to-video' task on the Hugging Face Hub?")
```
which outputs the following:
```
==Code generated by the agent==
model = model_download_counter(task="text-to-video")
print(f"The model with the most downloads is {model}.")
audio_model = text_reader(model)


==Result==
The model with the most downloads is damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b.
```

and generates the following audio.

<audio controls><source src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/damo.wav" type="audio/wav"> your browser does not support the audio element. </audio>

<Tip>

Depending on the LLM, some are quite brittle and require very exact prompts in order to work well. Having a well-defined
description of the tool is paramount to having it be leveraged by the agent.

</Tip>

### Replacing existing tools

Replacing existing tools can be done simply by assigning a new item to the agent's toolbox. Here's how one would do so:

```python
from transformers import HfAgent, load_tool

agent = HfAgent("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/bigcode/starcoder")
agent.toolbox['image-transformation'] = load_tool('diffusers/controlnet-canny-tool')
```

<Tip>

Beware when replacing tools with others! This will also replace the prompt. This can be good if you have a better
prompt suited for the task, but it can also result in your tool being selected way more than others or for other
tools to be selected instead of the one you have defined.
